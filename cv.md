## Positions

**2019-present	Research Scientist – Callsign (London, UK)** \
Currently developing new machine learning methodologies for biometric and behavioural user authentication systems.

**2016-2019	Post-Doctoral Research Associate – The University of Sheffield (Sheffield, UK)** \
Developed novel algorithms for autonomous processing of huge quantities of ultrasonic and machine vision data collected from robotic platforms.  Also developed algorithms for autonomous robotic inspection, using Bayesian optimisation techniques.

**2014-2016	Research Associate – The University of Sheffield with Ricardo ltd and Kongsberg Maritime (Sheffield, UK)** \
Delivered a large project between Ricardo ltd, The University of Sheffield and Kongsberg Maritime, where I developed novel machine learning-based solutions for condition monitoring of wind turbine components using acoustic emission and vibration data. 

**2012-2014	Technologist – Structural Health Monitoring Systems - University of Sheffield and HBM-Prenscia (Sheffield, UK)** \
Developed advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques for structural health monitoring applications. I also Introduced this technology into production software and aided into its commercialisation.

**2012-2012	Technologist - HBM-Prenscia and Leonardo Helicopters (Yeovil/Bristol, UK)** \
Short term project developing signal processing methods for application to operational modal analysis on helicopters. This involved a strong collaboration with the University of Bristol.

**2010-2011	Applications Engineer - HBM-Prenscia and Leonardo Helicopters (Yeovil, UK)** \
On-site representative of HBM-Prenscia at Leonardo Helicopters. I was responsible for vibration analysis from recorded flight-test data, qualification of equipment for durability, airframe modal analysis and testing, structural modification analysis and flight test specification.
